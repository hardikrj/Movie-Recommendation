# Movie-Recommendation

This project contains two parts. First, I will implement an LSH algorithm, using Jaccard similarity measurement, to find similar movies. Second, I will implement a collaborative-filtering recommendation system. The datasets I used are the MovieLens datasets. The goal here is to understand how different types of recommendation systems work and more importantly, try to find a way to improve the accuracy of the recommendation system.
